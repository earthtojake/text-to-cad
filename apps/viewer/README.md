# CAD Viewer

A local-filesystem CAD review app. This directory is the React CLIENT; the
backend is `cadgen viewer` — the `cadgen.viewer` package in the cadgen Python
distribution — and the built client ships inside that same wheel. One instance
serves ONE directory, fixed at start; the page is always the bare origin and
`?file=` selects an artifact inside that root. There is no hosted deployment.

**PURPOSE** — the application: all UI, workflow, and session state for
reviewing CAD artifacts (catalog, tabs, selection, pose, animation,
measurements, themes).

**MAY DEPEND ON** — `cadgen-js` (the shared CAD render/runtime package at
`packages/cadgen-js`, imported by the `cadgen-js` specifier) and its own npm
dependencies, all bundled into the client AT BUILD TIME. At run time it talks
to `cadgen viewer` over `/__cad` and `/__tess_cache`, and to nothing else.

**DEPENDED ON BY** — the cadgen wheel, which carries this client's build
(`cadgen/_runtime/viewer`). No code imports from this app.

## The laws that bind the app

- **One boundary**: the client imports `cadgen-js` by name and nothing else
  from outside this directory (`scripts/selfContained.test.mjs` is the fence).
  The backend is not here: its code, its tests and its laws live with cadgen.
- **Three-input law**: everything renders from the artifact file, its
  sidecar (`<name>.step.json`), and the cache. The viewer never reads
  source code and never rebuilds on source changes — generated outputs are
  detached, and a stale artifact stays stale until someone runs its script.
- **Kinematics/animation independence**: the Kinematics tab drives the sidecar's
  mate data through the shared FK runtime; the Animation tab evaluates the
  sidecar's copied `.anim.js` clips. They compose in the effect records and
  nowhere else.
- **Loud failure**: a missing entry, an unresolvable ref, or a failed
  compile surfaces as an alert — never a silently wrong scene.

## Launching

All commands run from this app's directory. Dev (Vite serves the client
from source with HMR; edits to `src/` and `packages/cadgen-js` show live):

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
# open http://127.0.0.1:5173/?file=<path relative to the served root>
```

Dev spawns the real backend — `python -m cadgen.viewer --api-only` on an
ephemeral port — and proxies `/__cad` and `/__tess_cache` to it, so there is one
implementation, not two, and Vite owns the client. `VIEWER_PYTHON` names the
interpreter that has cadgen installed (it defaults to `python3`, which on macOS
is still 3.9 — below the server's floor of 3.11 — and rarely the one with
cadgen); `VIEWER_BACKEND_URL` attaches to a backend you started yourself. No
build is needed first.

Prod is `cadgen viewer`, run FROM the directory to serve (there is no directory
flag, the cwd IS the served directory). In a checkout it serves this app's
`dist/` — build it first — and an installed wheel serves the copy it carries:

```bash
npm run build
cd <the directory to serve> && cadgen viewer --host 127.0.0.1 --json
```

The launcher is unconditional and prints the URL it serves: a live instance
already serving that realpath with the same code on disk is REUSED
(`action:"reused"`); otherwise it binds the first free port from 3245 upward.
`--new` forces a fresh instance of the same code; an explicit `--port` is
strict; `--dist DIR` (or `CADGEN_VIEWER_DIST`) names another built client. The
URL line (and the `--json` line) is written only after the socket is bound and
listening with the app attached, so the first request after reading it answers
— no poll, no retry, no grace period. `cadgen viewer list` shows every running
instance; `cadgen viewer stop --port <n>` ends one. Do not stop instances you
did not start. Dev lives on Vite's port (5173, strict) and never enters the
instance registry.

Reuse keys on realpath(served directory) × an identity token — the cadgen
version salted with the newest mtime across the server's `.py` files and the
built client — so an instance serving a different directory, the same directory
from another install, or code that has since been edited, pulled, or rebuilt is
never handed back by mistake. In a checkout, a server that finds `src/` beside
the `dist/` it serves also warns once on stderr when any source is newer than
the build — detection only; it keeps serving.

## Behaviours worth knowing before concluding something is broken

- **The catalog scan skips dot-directories.** A buildable entry under
  `.review/` (or any dotted path) never appears, even when the server is
  launched from inside it.
- **Verify a link by loading the page**, never by curling `/__cad/asset` —
  that route serves raw files; generated entries render through a
  different route, so probing it 404s whether or not anything is wrong.
- **Vite's transform cache can outlive HMR and hard reloads.** If a source
  edit does not show up, restart the dev server and delete
  `node_modules/.vite`.
- Never invoke the export routes from automation — they open native save-as
  dialogs.

## The shape of the app

```
src/client/ # React app: CadWorkspace (state root), CadViewer (scene +
            #   effects application), workbench/ (tabs, sections, session
            #   state, playback), render/ (viewport)
scripts/    # app tooling incl. e2e helpers and selfContained.test.mjs
            #   (the boundary fence) and the dev-backend spawn helpers
docs/       # subsystem docs; settings-ui.md is the CURATED design-system
            #   reference for all settings UI work — binding, read it
            #   before touching controls
dist/       # built client (gitignored); what `cadgen viewer` serves in a
            #   checkout and what the wheel bundles
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test    # client + app tooling (node:test, beside the code)
```

The backend's suite lives with cadgen and is not collected here; running only
`npm run test` leaves that half unchecked.

Headless UI verification uses Playwright with `--use-angle=metal` —
the default software WebGL renderer is not what users see.

## Robot components

URDF, SRDF, and SDF files with named objects in their linked meshes expose a
Components tab. Its single-line rows are grouped by link. Selecting a row
highlights that mesh object in the viewport; picking it in the viewport selects
and reveals its row. Ctrl/Cmd/Shift-click toggles additional components. Objects
retain their visual transforms as joints move. Unnamed objects remain rendered
but are omitted from the inventory; files without named objects have neither
Components nor the component Reference tab.

Reference shows the selected objects' link, visual, mesh, and object identifiers,
with a copy button for each. Robot references are prompt locators of the form
`models/robot.urdf#link=arm&visual=arm%3Av1&object=3mf%3A0&index=0&name=bracket`.
The prefix identifies the robot file; path segments and fragment values are percent-encoded.
`visual` is the parsed visual ID (`<link>:v<one-based visual ordinal>` for URDF);
`object` is the mesh loader's object ID and `index` its zero-based position in the
loaded mesh's parts list. `name` preserves the authored object name. Resolve the
link and visual in the robot description to find the mesh file, then identify
that mesh object using its name and index. Repeated mesh instances have distinct
references because they belong to different visuals. SRDF locators name the SRDF
file and resolve visuals through its paired URDF. SDF uses its parsed visual IDs.
These locators describe mesh objects for prompts; they are not STEP face selectors
and are not accepted by the STEP selector CLI. They remain stable across pose
changes, but reordering visuals or re-exporting a mesh can change the identifiers.
