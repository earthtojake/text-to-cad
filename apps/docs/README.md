# Docs site

The documentation website (Next.js) — texttocad.dev. A @text-to-cad/core CLIENT: the
hero and example scenes render real CAD models in the browser through the
same shared runtime the viewer uses.

**PURPOSE** — the public documentation and marketing site.

**MAY DEPEND ON** — compiled `@text-to-cad/core` exports and this app's own
npm dependencies. Never another app or the running cadgen Python service.
The root npm workspace and lockfile resolve dependencies; no source aliases
or consumer-owned declarations are required.

**DEPENDED ON BY** — nothing in the repo. It is a website, not an install.

The package migration is a pure refactor: the site's UI, UX, functionality, content and static
CAD showcases remain unchanged. Normal development, checks and deployment use
existing static assets and do not start Python. Asset regeneration is still an
explicit operation. The hero composes an explicit static HTTP resource provider
from core for descriptors, surfaces and sidecars. It needs no FileViewer host,
Electron services or Python backend; the resource-provider migration keeps its
existing static asset URLs and rendering behavior.

Install from the repository root with `npm ci` (or the docs-only workspace
filter), then `npm run build:docs`. `apps/docs/vercel.json` runs the root
workspace install and build from Vercel's `apps/docs` root directory. Shared
package outputs are built first; production uses the same package exports as
local development.


## Build and deploy

```bash
npm ci --workspace packages/core --workspace apps/docs
npm run build --workspace @text-to-cad/core
npm --prefix apps/docs run check    # the CI gate: lint + typecheck + build
```

Deployment is the `Deploy Docs` workflow only. It deploys a ref of this
repository (default `main`; a release passes its own commit, and a past release
is redeployed from its tag). The Vercel project's Root Directory setting (in
Vercel, not this repo) must point at `apps/docs`.

Hero STEP assets under `public/hero/` are a view of the tree behind the
planetary gear STEP (`assembly.json` + each component's `.surf`) plus its
schema-v9 sidecar with embedded animation, committed as PLAIN files (never LFS — Vercel serves them statically
with no backend). Refresh them after rebuilding the model:

```
python models/assemblies/src/planetary_gear_assembly/planetary_gear_assembly.py
node apps/docs/scripts/sync-hero-step-assets.mjs   # same CADGEN_CACHE_DIR as the build
```

The sync script asks cadgen for the tree by the STEP's bytes and exports a
view of it, so it never restates a store path. The check script
(`scripts/check-hero-step-assets.mjs`, part of `npm run check`) pins the surf
container and sidecar contracts against @text-to-cad/core so a schema bump cannot
silently break the hero render.

## The shape of the app

```
src/app/         # routes
src/components/  # site components incl. the CAD hero renderers
src/lib/         # site utilities
public/hero/     # showcase tree view + sidecar, plain files (never LFS)
scripts/         # asset checks
```

## Brand and loading icon

The header and favicons use the blue C with soft relief shading. The homepage
and repository README use the TEXT2CAD PNG. `/icon` provides downloadable
C, CAD and TEXT2CAD SVGs and PNGs, followed by the original animated loading-icon
playground. The original mesh, animation and the shared UI loading assets stay
unchanged.

The vectors live in `public/brand/`. Regenerate them and the viewer's static
copy from the repository root with `node scripts/brand/generate-logos.mjs`.
See [the brand recipe](../../scripts/brand/README.md) for the block grid,
projection, palette and favicon export. These are checked-in assets; ordinary
builds do not regenerate them.

The loading-icon playground retains play/pause, speed, five palettes, drag to
rotate, zoom, and PNG/GLB downloads. It starts paused for reduced motion.
Its source remains here:

- `src/lib/icon/model.mjs`: the Three.js mesh and animation generator.
- `src/lib/icon/stage.mjs`: camera, palettes and studio lighting.
- `src/components/icon-playground.tsx`: preview and PNG render.
- `scripts/icon/`: GLB export and geometry/animation verification.
- `public/icon/icon.glb`: generated before dev/build, ignored by Git.

The mesh has an icosahedral hub and twenty triangular prongs with flush roots
and rigid crowns. The GLB carries ten contraction cycles and a complete orbit;
at 4× playback these take two seconds and twenty seconds respectively.

```bash
npm --prefix apps/docs run icon:generate
npm --prefix apps/docs run icon:verify
```

`npm run check` also generates and verifies the GLB, checking closed meshes,
face winding, flush roots, rigid crowns, endpoints and the orbit loop.

## Visual system

The site uses shadcn's neutral light surfaces and the viewer's charcoal dark
surfaces, system sans-serif type, and the same 0.625rem radius scale. Blue primary
actions use muted shades of the logo's pastel blue through shadcn semantic
tokens: #2c7197 in light mode and #30779d in dark mode, with #f5fbff labels.
Text contrast is 5.14:1 and 4.73:1 respectively; the solid darker hover shades
also exceed 4.5:1. Focus rings use a deeper brand blue on white and the logo's
pale highlight on charcoal. All installation Copy buttons use the same blue
primary action style. Get Started uses the same heading
scale as Skills. Install boxes and explanatory text fill the content width.
Command text remains monospace. The unboxed wordmark and prominent tagline sit above
the independently framed CAD demo. The app owns
its tokens and primitives in `src/app/globals.css` and `src/components/ui/`,
without importing another app or the CAD UI package. Keep the palette aligned
with `packages/ui/src/styles/tokens.css` when the viewer's base theme changes.
